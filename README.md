# GMafell

GMafell is a fun personality-based sentence rewritter. I'm developing it as part
of my Masters research. It heavily depends on [libgwords](https://github.com/GeorgesStavracas/libgwords), a
natural language text management library that I'm also developing as part of (but
not limited to) my Masters program.


** This repository is for study and fun purposes only. I'm not accepting external
contributions on GMafell. If you want to join the development of natural language
applications for GNOME, consider contributing to libgwords and GNLP.**
